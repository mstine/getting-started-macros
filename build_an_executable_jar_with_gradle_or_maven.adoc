:linkattrs:

Use Gradle to build an executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
./gradlew build
....

Gradle places the build artifact in the following location:

....
build/libs/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
....

Alternatively, use Maven to build the JAR file:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
mvn clean package
....

The Maven build artifact is available at the following path:

....
target/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
....
